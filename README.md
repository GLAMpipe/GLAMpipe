GLAMpipe is starting to found its shape. It's by no means production ready yet. 


## installation (work in progress)

GLAMpipe can be run on Linux as a nodejs application or it can be run via Docker/Docker Compose  (also on Mac, Windows not tested).

Try Docker Compose installation first. It will run MongoDB for you and it also takes care of linking MongoDB and GLAMpipe.


### Docker Compose (needs more testing)

GLAMpipe can be installed via [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). So first you need to install Docker:
https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/


1. Clone GLAMpipe repository:

        git clone https://github.com/artturimatias/GLAMpipe.git
        cd GLAMpipe



2. Then install GLAMpipe. There is a dockerhub image that you can use:

        docker-compose pull
        
    Or, if you want to build from source:
 
        docker-compose build
        
    And finally:
        
        docker-compose up


This takes a while at first time but next time the start up is almost instant. Finally you should see something like this:

    
        ********************* G L A M p i pe *************************
        * DATA PATH: /home/arihayri/GLAMpipe_DATA
        * NODE PATH: 
        * STATUS:    running on http://0.0.0.0:3000
        ********************* G L A M p i pe *************************
        


 Just type http://localhost:3000 in your browser and you should have GLAMpipe in front of you. 
 You can stop GLAMpipe by pressing CTRL + C
 
#### Possible problems with docker compose install

When you run "docker-compose up" command first time, the mongo service might start later that GLAMpipe. This means that GLAMpipe refuses to start. Just press CTRL + C and then type again "docker-compose up".

If there is still a problem with database, you can try to start mongo first:

	docker-compose up -d mongo

And then:

	docker-compose up glam



### Native nodejs install on Linux (Debian-based distros)

If you have a Linux box or you can run Linux in virtual machine, then these instructions should get you going with GLAMpipe.

1. First install mongo database and git

         apt-get install mongodb git
         
    Test that Mongo is really running. Just type:
    
        mongo
    You should see something like this:
    
        MongoDB shell version: 2.4.10
        connecting to: test
        > 

     Press CTRL + C to exit MongoDB Shell.


2. Then install nodejs. Nodejs in Debian repository is quite old so it is better to install from nodesource: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions

    execute as root:

        curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | bash -
        apt-get install -y nodejs


3. Create a installation directory for GLAMpipe and cd to it (as normal user)

        cd directory_you_just_created

4. Fetch GLAMpipe code from GitHub

        git clone https://github.com/artturimatias/GLAMpipe.git
        cd GLAMpipe

5. Create data directory for GLAMpipe and set it as dataPath in config/config.js.

    for example:

        mkdir /home/YOUR_USERNAME_HERE/GLAMpipe_DATA 
    sdf

        // DATAPATH
        // - where GLAMpipe can strore project data
        // default: ""
        var dataPath = "/home/__YOUR_USERNAME_HERE__/GLAMpipe_DATA ;

6. Install node dependencies

        npm install

7. Try to run

        node glampipe.js

    You should see something like this:
    
        ********************* G L A M p i pe *************************
        * DATA PATH: /home/arihayri/GLAMpipe_DATA
        * NODE PATH: 
        * STATUS:    running on http://127.0.0.1:3000
        ********************* G L A M p i pe *************************
        
    You can stop GLAMpipe by pressing CTRL + C




##Upgrading
Just type

	git pull
and then

	docker-compose build
	docker-compose up
