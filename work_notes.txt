Nodes and cores

Nodes are synchronous code. No file writing or web requests. In order to write file or make a web request the node can use core modules.

Node gives options to core module and the result is given back to node.

Currently available core modules:
- web
- (pdf)
- (csv)


Core communication


* things that are set in GP-node
core.options
- options object for core module (core request)
- the format depends on core module (for example, options object for web-core options is the options of request module)

core.skip
- tell core to skip this request
- if skip is non-empty, it is passed to a next round as core.error
core.skip = "no file present"
if(core.error)
 out.value = GP.error + core.error


* Things that are set by core
core.data
- data that is coming from core module (core response)

core.error
- is set when core can not fulfill the request (file is missing, network error etc.)
  OR
  if core.skip is non-empty


OPTIONS
Options are node type specific values stored in the database. These are used mostly for URLs for nodes (like DSpace nodes)

SCHEMA
Every collection has their own schema in gp__schemas. Schema keeps track of fields in the collection. 
source:
- when a source node is run, the createSchema is run after every import
- this results the "original fields" list

process and export:
- if node uses out.setter, then fields in the setter are added to schema in every round.
- if node has setings.out_value, then this is added to the the schema when node is created
