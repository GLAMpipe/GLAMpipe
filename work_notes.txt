Nodes and cores

Nodes are synchronous code. No file writing or web requests. In order to write file or make a web request the node can use core modules.

Node gives options to core module and the result is given back to node.

Currently available core modules:
- web
- (pdf)
- (csv)


Core communication


* things that are set in GP-node
core.options
- options object for core module (core request)
- the format depends on core module (for example, options object for web-core options is the options of request module)

core.skip
- tell core to skip this request
- if skip is non-empty, it is passed to a next round as core.error
core.skip = "no file present"
if(core.error)
 out.value = GP.error + core.error


* Things that are set by core
core.data
- data that is coming from core module (core response)

core.error
- is set when core can not fulfill the request (file is missing, network error etc.)
  OR
  if core.skip is non-empty
